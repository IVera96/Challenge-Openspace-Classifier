## Remarks
+ hardcoded value ```extra_tables = calculte_tables_for_unseated(9,2,6)```
+ code does not work if I modify the excel down to 5 names or up to 40 names (error and does not handle more people) but I remember it was the last issue you've encountered before the deadline. 
+ file_utils not used
+ git tree is beautiful that's good work
+ html interface not working? instructions?
+ you've started the interactive part of it but not finished
+ you forgot to call store() at the end of it but it works so OK
+ at the end of a project don't forget to delete remaining branches to clean the repo

## General remark
Good project! :fire: 
Nor perfect but that was not the goal, I can see you've been a good team. Python and git are good but reinforce OOP and project architecture. Use draw.io or that kind of tools to have a graphical flow/architecture to spot problems.
