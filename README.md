##âœ¨Project: Challenge: OOP in Python to Organize the Training Room âœ¨

Our project creates an algorithm that randomly assigns people to a spot in the open space.

Wondering how it works ðŸ¤”?

The tool allows users to organize people into tables, check seat availability, and save the current seating arrangement in a CSV file for easy reference.

ðŸŒ± To create the project, we used different tools like classes, methods, and functions.
We also imported various libraries, such as pandas, random, and List.

To write and run our script, we used Visual Studio. For collaboration, we used GitHub (what a beautiful environment!), and of course, to share our algorithm there, we used GIT( used without any problem ðŸ˜„).

We have worked as a real team âš¡ from the beginning. We created our commits with messages to keep track of our contributions and we also have collaborated while we had wrote our part.
